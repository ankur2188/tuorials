working copy > staging area > repository
git diff - compares working copy and repo copy, but since after git add it moves to stagin ared, git diff does not show any differences.
git diff --staged
git rm third.txt - removes from repo and working copy as well.
Rename -> rename file on disk, do git rm updated.txt and then git add old.txt. Git will realize that u did rename, check this by doing git status
Easy way to rename -> git mv second.txt pudding.txt
git mv pudding.txt LoveNotes/patty.txt
git commit -am "Commit directly to repo", use it when made general edits to the file not when rename and move is done.
