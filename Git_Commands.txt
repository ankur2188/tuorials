git init
ls -la
git add .
git add third.txt
git commit -m "first commit"
git log
git log --author="ankur"
working copy > staging area > repository
git diff - compares working copy and repo copy, but since after git add it moves to stagin ared, git diff does not show any differences.
git diff --staged
git rm third.txt - removes from repo and working copy as well.
Rename -> rename file on disk, do git rm updated.txt and then git add old.txt. Git will realize that u did rename, check this by doing git status
Easy way to rename -> git mv second.txt pudding.txt
git mv pudding.txt LoveNotes/patty.txt
git commit -am "Commit directly to repo", use it when made general edits to the file not when rename and move is done.

Undo the changes
-----------------
1. git status for changes.
2. git checkout -- index.html , checks out the file from the repository and make it your working copy

Bring down from staging area
-----------------------------
1. git add .
2. git status -> moves to staging
3. git reset HEAD index.html -> removes from staging.

Getting older version from Repo
--------------------------------
1. 1st > 2nd > 3rd > 2nd

git checkout 123432 -- index.html

Pushing to github remote repo
------------------------------

git remote add remoteRepoAlias https://github.com/ankur2188/tuorials.git
git push -u remoteRepoAlias master -> add files

Github desktop
----------------
.gitignore for ignoring few files.

Branches
---------
Create branch, add a file, create pull request from the new branch and approve it for the master brach by doing merge pull request.

Use raw mode for code copying.

Watch/UnWatch - getting notifications
Star/Unstar - bookmarking
Fork - work with other projects and it creates master of the same repo for u. Once u have changes to commit, u can create a new pull request.

Issues/Labels
--------------
created in github and label them like bud, enhancemen etc
new labels can be created.

Wiki can be added for more documentation around project.

Creating organization from the same place where we create new repository, makes u create private repo and offer plans at some cost for this.
